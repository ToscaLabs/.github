# ToscaLabs

Welcome to **ToscaLabs**! We are a small organization focused on developing
software solutions that address challenges in social contexts.  
Our competence lies in leveraging modern programming language and cutting-edge
technologies to build versatile libraries and innovative tools.

We tend to pay close attention to social problems for which computer science can
provide effective solutions, in the hope that our items can help others.

Our main project is a **versatile**, **customizable**, and **secure** IoT
framework called [tosca](https://github.com/ToscaLabs/tosca).  
Written in [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/), we guarantee memory and thread safety
through its rich type system and ownership model, preventing many classes of
bugs at compile-time.  
The framework provides APIs for developing firmware for a variety of hardware
architectures, as well as APIs for creating software that interacts with these
devices.  
Most APIs can be viewed as blocks, each representing a single feature or a
group of related features. These blocks can be easily combined by adding or
removing lines of code, allowing the final software to be customized
based on developer needs.

Another one of our creations is [lich](https://github.com/ToscaLabs/lich),
an IoT firmware analyzer designed to identify internal vulnerabilities and
extract energy consumption data. We have also developed this tool using the Rust
language.

In this organization, we host both public and private repositories, depending on
the requests of those who interact with us.  
When you come across a public repository that inspire you, feel free to open a
pull request without hesitation.  
Thanks in advance!

Oh, and if you think your project might be a good fit for ToscaLabs, please
